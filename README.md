# java-algos

Welcome to Ninja's algo repos! This is here so we can all start thinking in alogrithmic(is this a word?) ways.
Here will be a collections of algos we will be working on! Please refer to the [Lucid Chart](https://lucid.app/lucidspark/39d3ca8a-f6d1-4ce7-be56-4904f737669c/edit#) I made for us!

## What to keep in mind

- Time & Memory Complexity
- Trade offs
- Thinking outloud
- Whiteboarding / Don't run!
- Debugging ( Stepping through code)
